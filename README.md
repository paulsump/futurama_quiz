# Futurama Characters and Quiz

- Demonstration of basic Flutter UI of data fetched from a simple API.

## Bugs

- ListView unresponsive in landscape. Reproduce: Zoidberg.

## To do now

- display error on screen if no internet
- don't add any info, characters or questions that had bad date (catch them).
- adjust Font size for different screens. e.g. answers.
- SnackBar delay is long, so need to cancel it if already on a couple of questions ahead. Probably
  wouldn't happen if doing the quiz properly.

## To do

- Borders.
- More obvious buttons.
- SnackBar text color.
- Check all TODOs
- remove all hacks
- Check able to run on any device
- running Android 7 (API 24) or greater. Font sizes and bold.

### Tests to do

- Page navigation in different orientations (at least no exceptions).
- Mock client.

### Ideas

- tool tips
- dark theme
- Click on text to choose radio. Fry starts big then animates small when haveInfo API.
- Tick and cross icons on core and snackBar. Hero animations.

### Ideas (Later/Never)

- Consistent font e.g. is snackBar different?
- Random character avatars e.g. on snackBar.
- //Pick character... Character then uses tube lift in quiz.
